# Conway's game of life

This is an implementation of Conway's game of life. It is defined by a simple set of rules, which apply to each node on a grid. The rules are the following:

1. If a live cell has less than two neighbors, it dies.
2. If a live cell has two or three neighbors, it lives to the next generation.
3. If a live cell has more than three neighbors, it dies.
4. If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it lives.

This simple set of rules results in complex, emergent behavior.
